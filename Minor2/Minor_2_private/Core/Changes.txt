1. Round Robin Algorithm Drawbacks
    Choose a pattern that gives 4th task to data centre and thus shows that round robin has problem of overloading the server

2. Least connection should not go to data centre

3. Implement Task capacity on the basis of line of code

4. Least connection: We are checking all three edge nodes at once therefore we know that we cant send the task to any other edge nodes 


PROBLEMS:
1. THE ERROR MESSAGE IN LEAST WORKLOAD i.e THE COUNTER IN LEAST WORKLOAD.


PROBLEMS:


3. Clear i/p terminal 
4.
